# Image-to-text-using-object-detection-
This repo is for self learning purpose 

For soloving your problem statement i have created a Deep learning pipeline 
a) first preprocess the images using opencv and save them in there dir
b) Using object detection i have detected the the text and barcode in the images and crop those images and save in result floder
c) using tesseract coverted those images into text and save  it in new.csv file with floder and image name and text in that particular images
 


I have created Two Dir

1) fresh_solution 
2) fresh_solution (copy)

In fresh_solution (copy) i have witten 4 ipython notebook Books 

1) preprocessing1.ipynb for preprocessing the images
2) yolo.final.ipynb for detecting text and barcode in images and save the into the result dir
3) ocr.ipynb for getting text 


In fresh_solution i have witten 1 ipython notebook Books

it is for your reffernce to run the whole code at one time and see the results ( all in one.ipynb)
